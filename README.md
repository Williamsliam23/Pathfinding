# Pathfinding

This project is a demonstration of pathfinding in programming done with the A* algorithm. The A* algorithm searches through simple node traversal to find the shortest available path to its target destination. A* will be demonstrated with visual navigation through mazes showing how the search determines where it goes as the algorithm progresses, and how it arrives at its final path.

## Hosted:
https://williamsliam23.github.io/Pathfinding/

## In Pathfinding, users will be able to:

- Choose from preset initial mazes for traversal
- Start, pause, reset, and show path costs as the traversal happens
- Learn about the functionality and history of A*
- Toggle seeing code move through its lines showing how it is written and its pattern

## Additionally, this demo will include:

- An instruction page, detailing how to use the page
- A production README

- Navigation links to GitHub repo, LinkedIn, and Instruction
- On the left, maze layouts for users to select
- Controls on the bottom of the page
- A* information on the top of the page
- Screen on the left for users to toggle the ability to create their own maze/map (bonus)

## This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- The Canvas API to render the mazes and traversal progress
- Webpack to bundle the source JavaScript code
- npm for managing dependencies in the project

## Implementation Timeline

- **Friday & Weekend**: Initial setup for project, getting webpack started, start with initial canvas(d3) and get familiar with api implementation. Initial class creations for the grid blocks and the grid container. 
- **Monday**: Have A* implemented and working with non visual examples. Create user controls on page
- **Tuesday**: Create the canvas to show each move of A* traversal with proper rendering
- **Wednesday**: Finish styling for the page. Should time allow start on bonus for user to create custom mazes/maps
- **Thursday**: Deploy project to GitHub Pages. Create production README.
