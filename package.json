  "description": "This project is a demonstration of pathfinding in programming done with the A* algorithm. The A* algorithm searches through simple node traversal to find the shortest available path to its target destination. A* will be demonstrated with visual navigation through mazes showing how the search determines where it goes as the algorithm progresses, and how it arrives at its final path.",
